# chinese-card-generator

This extension is done to create cards using vocabulary saved with the [Zhongwen](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen) browser extension.

The base information are taken from zhongwen (simplified characters, traditional characters, pinyin and meaning). Then 
example sentences are added by querying the Totoaba API (sentence example, sentence meaning), the pinyin of the sentence 
is generated using the [pinyin]() library. Moreover synonyms are added to the entry if avalaible. The synonyms are querried
using [chatopera]() and their meaning are generated using the GoogleTranslate module from the [deep-translation]() library.
